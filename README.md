# Weather
* Idea from [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/weather-app).
* Consumes the [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) API to display weather data.
* [Live preview](https://ndmekala.github.io/weather).
* I feature this project in my [portfolio](https://www.meka.la/).
